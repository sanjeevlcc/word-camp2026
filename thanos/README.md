# 🧤 Thanos Gauntlet: WordPress Docker Architecture

This project organizes a high-performance WordPress stack where each service is mapped to an **Infinity Stone**, creating a perfectly balanced infrastructure.

## 🎨 The Infinity Mapping

| Stone | Power | Docker Service | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🟠 **Reality** | Bending Reality | **Docker Compose** | Defines and controls the entire universe (stack). |
| 🔵 **Space** | Presence | **WordPress** | The physical presence and content in the web space. |
| 🔴 **Mind** | Consciousness | **PHP-FPM** | The logic, execution, and decision-making engine. |
| 🟣 **Power** | Raw Force | **Nginx** | Handles massive traffic with efficiency and strength. |
| 🟡 **Soul** | Essence | **MariaDB** | Stores the soul (data) of the entire application. |
| 🟢 **Time** | Speed | **Redis** | Manipulates time through high-speed caching. |

## 🧠 Concept Explanation

* **Docker Compose (Reality Stone):** The master orchestrator. It bends the "reality" of the host machine to create an isolated environment where all services coexist.
* **WordPress (Space Stone):** The core application. It establishes the "presence" of the site across the digital landscape.
* **PHP-FPM (Mind Stone):** The intellect. It processes the complex PHP logic, executes the code, and makes decisions based on user requests.
* **Nginx (Power Stone):** The shield and the sword. It handles raw traffic, serves static assets, and protects the inner services from direct exposure.
* **MariaDB (Soul Stone):** The heart of the stack. It contains the data, posts, and user information that give the site its "soul."
* **Redis (Time Stone):** The accelerator. It slows down the "clock" for the server by caching data, ensuring responses reach the user in a fraction of the time.
